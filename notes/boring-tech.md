## General Rule: Work projects should be built on the most boring tech possible
> I want to spend time building things, not maintaining things.

### Boring is for builders
Playing with tech is preventing us from building the things that we need to build. Tech for work should be expected and standardized, like a light switch.

### Hobbies is for chaotic tech
Leave chaotic tech where nobody else is dependent on it. Prioritizing hobby interests over actual customer needs is harmful.

## Context matters! (CHAOS)
Using new tech is dependent on what the needs and situtation presents.

#### C - complexity
How many things need to be thought about for this
#### H - Hazardous
How many things can break?
#### A - Aspirational
How many real world apps use this?
#### O - Opaque
Are there docs available?
#### S - Speculative
Have teams ever shipped this before, or is this uncharted waters?



## Keep Work Boring (BORED)
#### B - Balanced 
We can accurately assess the trade-offs of putting this tool into production
#### O - Obvious 
Deal with very few moving parts
#### R - Reliable 
Tech should be reliable and never need to be thought about again
#### E - Established 
With a healthy community and ecosystem, even when the code is no longer trendy
#### D - Documented 
What are the case studies and implications? 

Keep the good kind of excitement - team excitement about finishing projects.
Boring means balance, not stagnation. New technology needs to go through a thorough risk assessment. Does this tech handle the needs we have?

## Questions to ask:
* What infrastructure changes are required? Who manages that?
* Who gets contacted when this goes down? And what piece?
* Who maintains this?
* What isn't getting built to make room for maintenance?
* Will this solve a real world problem or is it kicking the can down the road?
