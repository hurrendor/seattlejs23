## LLMs (Large Language Model)
Neural Network - Set of algorithms working to recognize connectinos in a data set, imitating neurons in the human brain.

LLMs are neural networks trained on massive quantities of text to gain tone, structure and types of data.

## What is LangChain
Open source JavaScript framework built around LLMs. Modular components.

### Modules:

#### Prompt templates
Recipes to generate LLM prompts. The same object can be reused with different data.
Several providers available: OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.

#### LLMs

#### Chains and Agents


## Breakdown
Different elements provide enhanced abilities, each wrapper around a series of single components. 

Chains are a predetermined set of steps.

Agents - Action agents or plan-and-execute agents. Agents decided on the next action based on the output of the previous action. Agents can use tools.

Tools - functions or utilites that agents use to perform different tasks. Provides more data search options or enhanced capabilities.

Executor - A type of agent with a set of tools.

LangChain
Links LLMs to other LLMs to get better results. Essentially a community of LLMs.
