## Rebuilding in Rust for Good Reason - Eve Porcello
[Talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHSE5t5CzU8)

Migrating from writing in JavaScript into Rust. Give the Rust crab all of your money.

### General:
Uses **cargo** to create packages. Creates a `Cargo.toml` file. Packages up code into a tidy executable that can be runnable from wherever (using `rustc mainFile.js`)

### Benefits found:
- Keeping applications smaller with faster speeds.
- Stricter typing
[Rust Playground](play.rust-lang.org)

### Caveats:
* Uses only double quotes
