## Historical JavaScript Additions from previous years
## [ES7 -2016](https://262.ecma-international.org/7.0/) 
* Adds `includes`

## [ES8-2017](https://262.ecma-international.org/8.0/)
* Introduction of `async/await`
`Object.entries`
`Object.values`

## [ES9 - 2018](https://262.ecma-international.org/9.0/)
* Adding rest/spread proprerties
* Aysnc iterators
* `Promise.finally()`
* RegEx improvements

## [ES10- 2019](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/)
* `Array.flat()` and `Array.flatMap()`
* try/catch

## [ES11 - 2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/)
* Optional chaining handles nested structures
* `??` (nullish) operator - checking for null or undefined values

## [ES12 - 2021](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/)
* Numeric separators
* `Promise.any()`

## ES13 - 2022
* Top level `await`
    * Allows await outside of async function
    * Yay - simplified code! 
* `Object.hasOwn()`
* Private class methods and fields
    * Helps provide encapsulation
    * Uses `#` in variable naming - ex: `#name = 'John Doe'`
* Static class fields
    * Can only be used by static methods
* `at()` method for indexing
    * Surpasses bracket notation and handles edge casing with strings and negative numbers

## ES14 - 2023
Array methods:
* `toSorted()`
    * returns array sorted in ascending order
* `toReversed()`
    * original array in reverse order
* `findLast()`
    * returns last element of the arrray that matches the specified predicate function
* `findLastIndex()`
    * like above but returns the index instead of the element
* `toSpliced()`
    * Returns copy of the original array with specified elements spliced out

* Shebang comments
    * Unix-based scripting base used to denote script execution
    `#!/usr/bin/node`
* Symbols as weak map keys
    * Symbols can be used
    * Weak maps remove data that is not referenced by any other object

## What's Next?
* `await` increased in usage 26.5%
* Vite is growing
* Globally distributed talent is growing
* Performance innovations around reactivity and hydration
* People are conflicted about private fields

## ES15 and Beyond
* More focus on ES Modules
* More Functional programming (think lodash, lambda)
* Better asynchronous handling
* More TypeScript!
    >It's time to learn TypeScript, my dudes!
* WebAssembly integration
* Performance improvements
* Progressive web apps
* More accessible AI
